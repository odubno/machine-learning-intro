### Determinant
  * Tells us the size by which the [unit vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector) will scale or decrease by i.e. be transformed by.
  * The determinant tells us the factor by which areas are stretch or shrunk by. 
    * great than one, then the area is growing.
    * less than one, then the area is shrinking.
```
   i j
  [1 0]
  [0 1]
```
```
  [3 1]
  [0 2]

^ has a derminant of 6 i.e. (3*2)-(1*0)
That means 

  [1 0]
  [0 1]

will grow 6 times it's size; the area will be 6 times the original size of the unit vectors.
```
 * If the determinant is zero, there is no inverse.
